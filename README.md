# Hello!
If you are reading this, you are at my GitHub page! Here is where you would be able to view all of the work and reflections that I have done for my various classes while studying at Champlain College! I believe I have learned quite a lot at my time here at Champlain, but a lot of these repositories may not initially make a lot of sense to you, as they just appear to be an assortment of numbers and letters. This is why I decided to make this read me page to tell you what each repository is, and a brief synopsis of what I learned and covered within each, so if you would like to check one out, you can after reading this.

## SYS-350: Enterprise Virtual
This class focuses a lot on the usage of vSphere Hypervisor. Within this class we focused a lot on setting up small enterprises that contained:
* Virtual Networking via the usage of Clusters within vCenter
* Storage such as NFS and ISCSI
* High Availability within Virtual Environments through the usage of vMotion and SRM
* Automation via the usage of Ansible and PowerCLI
* Advanced Microsoft AD topics such as AD Forests and Federated Services

## SEC-440: Systems Security
This class integrated concepts of previous courses at Champlain college to create a comprehensive perspective of security for an information system. We covered hardware, software protocols, prevention and so much more! In this class:
* Constructed system performance and security architectures
* Implement secure access to system and network services via host-based access and system services
* Combined secure architectures to secure data
* Designed network resource access controls
* Created a High Availability Network with multiple VYOS firewalls, Web Servers and Web Proxy Servers
* Created a Federated Identity Project, in which I was able to use Discord in order to login to my Wordpress server
* Worked on a Network Privacy Project that had me and a partner investigate an area of privacy we have not investigated before, we ended up choosing ShadowSocks, a secure socks5 proxy to protect internet traffic
* Kerberos for authentication
* LDAP & SElinux
* A final project in which I set up a large collection of Honeypots alongside an ELK stack to collect a large amount of malicious actor data

## SYS/SEC/NET-480-01: Advanced Topics in Systems Administration and It Infrastructure
This was an advanced course I took that explored late breaking topics in security, networking and system administration. When I took this course, it focused mainly on System Administration. We covered a lot in this class, like:
* Automation via Ansible, Chocolatey, Docker, iPXE and Kubernetes
* Leveraged a physical server remotely to host enterprise level virtualization
* Used IPMI to install and configure and ESXI server
* Built an infrastructure that supports bare metal provisioning of Linux and Windows
* Created and Deployed unconfigured OS using Ansible and PowerCLI
* Automated the configurations of Windows Domain and Linux web applications
* Used FOG image captures to quickly deploy Virtual Machines
* Swarm and Overlay Networks using amazon AWS

## CCC-410/412 Capstone Design and Capstone Project
This is a single repository where I noted some of my adventures working on my capstone project. Here is where I documented a lot of my personal plans for a project I worked on with a fellow Champlain Student. I focused mainly on creating Linux and Packet Tracer VMs and Lab Guides to be used by the CyberPatriot Organization.

Unfortunately, these last two classes NET-330 Network Design and SEC-350 Enterprise and Network Security Controls are not that well populated. With the first class being heavily altered by the Coronavirus Pandemic, we ended up not using it as much as planned, and with SEC-350, we ended up shifting over to use a different system that I no longer have access to. However, NET-330 ended up teaching me greatly about the principles and methodologies in design of local and wide area networks via the use of packet tracer and physical hardware, while SEC-350 taught me heavily about how to examine network-based threats and how to protect, detect and defend the enterprise from such attacks using tools such as the VYOS firewall and Log Management resources such as Splunk. A lot of this was covered in my 480-01 class as well as 440 though, so not all is gone!

That is all, I hope you enjoy it!
